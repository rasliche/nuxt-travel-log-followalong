# Nuxt Travel Log Followalong

A full stack application built with Nuxt that allows users to keep track of all the places they've been. Based on [@w3cj/nuxt-travel-log](https://github.com/w3cj/nuxt-travel-log) with a few changes to align with my preferences (such as using npm instead of pnmp).

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
```
